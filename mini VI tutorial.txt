****************** My mini vi tutorial ******************
********************************************************

	1. th start vi:
		$vi
		OR
		$vi <fileName>
	2. the second step: 
		press 'i' to enter the insert mode
	3. write the text you want
	4. to save:
		a. Press 'ESC'
		b. write ':w' DONT forget the ':' before the w
		OR
		:w fileNameToBeSavedin , to write to another file.
	5. to quit vi:
		'ESC' to enter the command mode
		':q' to quit
		':q!' to quit without saving changes

	IMPORTANT:
		when u open an existing file for edit, U cant update in it , THATS because u still in the 
		command mode, So, u need to press the 'i' to start editing it
		the same situation happend after issuing a command< with ESC> u need to enter the 'i' letter
		in order to proceed with editing the file after - for example, saving it .
	
	6. to search for a word:
		starting from the current curser position:
		in the Command mode, type '/theWordToSearchFor' for forward search, and 
		'?theWordToSearchFor' for backword search.
		ex: let's search for the word 'ESC' in this file
			a. enter the Command mode by pressing ESC
			b. type: '/ESC'
			c. the cursor will go automatically to thefirt occurance of the wordfound
			d. to search for the next occurance, press the 'n' key
			e. to search for the previous occurance, press the 'N' key

	IMPORTANT: the search is key-sensitive : < if u try to earch for 'esc' the small letters, 
	no results will appear>
